This folder contains one experimental dataset (scan01) from scanning transmission electron microscopy at Cornell University, published in the following paper. This paper should be cited whenever this code, dataset or their derivatives are used: 
Chen, Z., et al., Electron ptychography achieves atomic-resolution limits set by lattice vibrations. arXiv: 2101.00465.
(large diffraction data needs to be loaded from PARADIM website: https://data.paradim.org/, check our paper for more details).
